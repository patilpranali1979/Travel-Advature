  <p>Travelling has always excited me and when it gets more adventurous it is more interesting. I love travelling and so do my parents.
So whenever they get time, we set out for our great journeys that are filled with lots of adventures, fun and excitement.This time we thought we would go trekking. I was so excited that I could not sleep for days. I have only seen in movies and read in books how difficult it is and how one does trekking. My father told me that I would not be allowed great heights and no fuss at the location and so I had no choice, other than listen to him. We, along with our family friends, on our holidays planned our trip and started preparations for it. We used to do our daily exercises so that it would strengthen our bones and muscles for the climb.On the D-day we were so excited that we kids could not control it.</p>
